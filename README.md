## My process
Firstly, I selected the right project then I created for this project file.I set up semantic HTML and upon writing CSS, tried to develop the right way step be step.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox




### What I learned

I set to flex and exactly background.



```html
<article class="card"></article>
```
```css
.card{
  display:flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items:center;
  min-height: 100vh;
  background:linear-gradient(45deg,#fbda61,#ff5acd);
}
```



### Continued development

I want to try "text animation effects" and grid system in the future on the level phase.
